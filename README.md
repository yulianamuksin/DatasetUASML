# Machine Learning Algorithms on Mixed High Dimensionality Dataset

In this project I did comparison and analysis of the difference in performances of several Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Gaussian Mixture Model, and K-Means Clustering) in predicting target features of a Mixed dataset with high-dimensionality containing 13,000 raw categorical & numerical records, and missing values. 

I performed Feature Engineering and Feature Selection (SelectKBest) on each model, which increased the accuracies up to around 87% on average.
